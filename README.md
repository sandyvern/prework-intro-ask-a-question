# Ask Questions on Learn

## Learning Goals

- Know how to get help
- Better understand the purpose of Ask A Question (AAQ) and how it works

## Introduction

As you go through the labs and lessons here, you do much of the work on your
own. While this isn’t a bad thing (time for independent thinking and debugging
is necessary!), you are going to get stuck sometimes! As with any new skill you
learn, coding can be difficult and frustrating. After a certain point, being
stuck on a problem becomes counterproductive - you’re stuck and you need help
getting unstuck!

Many aspects of learning are inherently social, and it helps to talk problems
through with individuals who have experienced many of the same problems as you!
That’s where Technical Coaches (TCs) come in.

## Who are TCs?

TCs help students get unstuck and guide students through pair programming. TCs
are a team of Flatiron graduates, so they are intimately familiar with Flatiron
School's curriculum. Some are recent graduates, and some are currently at other
development jobs outside of Flatiron. With this experience, they are perfectly
suited to give you a nudge in the right direction! You’ll know you’re working
with a TC if you see a blue Learn badge next to their profile picture.

## Get Help In Real Time

One of the great things about AAQ is the responsiveness of TCs - when TCs are
online, you can generally expect to receive a response within a couple of
minutes, provided that it isn’t very busy! While you can open a question in AAQ
at any time of day,
[TCs are only available for certain hours of the day][hours]. TCs generally
support students through chat in AAQ and through 20-minute pairing sessions over
Zoom. You can ask a question by clicking the purple “Ask A Question” button in
the top right of your current lesson or lab.

**Questions must be related to the current lesson or lab that you are working on.**
AAQ does not support questions related to portfolio projects, code challenges,
or other personal projects.

AAQ exists to help Flatiron students learn to debug their issues successfully.
This gets easier with practice! Whenever possible, you should try to
troubleshoot your issue independently first before seeking help.

Some examples of independent troubleshooting might look like:

- Checking out [Learn's help articles](help.learn.co) - these articles include advice and answers to
  frequently asked questions from the Flatiron School Team: help.learn.co
- Reading the Readme thoroughly for the lab you’re on to make sure you’re not missing relevant details
- Reviewing previous Learn lessons that may apply to the error or issue
you’re experiencing
- Googling your error or related concepts
- Using debugging tools like [Pry](http://pry.github.io/) to understand your error better

That being said, sometimes you are just stuck and truly need a hand - if you
have tried the above solutions for 20-30 minutes, please feel free to open a
question! We are happy to help. This article provides some pointers on
[how to ask a question effectively.][how to]

## Who We Serve

Technical Coaches provide support for the programs listed in
[this article][supported tracks]. At any given time there may be 2-5 TCs online;
staffing is based on how busy it **typically** is during that time of day. Sometimes
it gets very busy in AAQ unexpectedly! At any given time, there may be anywhere
from 1-15 active questions (sometimes more!). Please be patient with us as we
try to help.

## Why do Technical Coaches Not Give Out Answers?

The goal at AAQ is to help students learn how to think critically about code -
this doesn’t happen if we give you answers directly! We use a few different
general strategies to help accomplish this goal:

- We use the [Socratic method][] and other questioning techniques.
- We may recommend that you Google certain concepts, or give you suggestions on
  terms to Google
- We may provide you with additional resources on a relevant coding concept to
  supplement your understanding or help you to think about a problem differently
- We may provide you with some [pseudocode][] or guide you to construct some
  pseudocode yourself!

## Conclusion

Ask A Question is here to help support you as you continue your journey to learn
to code. While ultimately you must hold yourself accountable for learning the
concepts in this course, and for developing your debugging skills as a
programmer, we are here to support you! If you are stuck, do not hesitate to ask
for help!
